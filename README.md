### üçî **Prelim Project: Restaurant Ordering System with Factory Method & Builder Patterns**

#### üîß **Project Overview:**
Create a TypeScript console application that simulates an ordering system for three types of meals: **Burgers**, **Sandwiches**, and **Burritos**. The project will use the **Factory Method** to create different meals and the **Builder** pattern to customize them with specific ingredients (e.g., toppings, sauces, etc.). 

#### üìù **Requirements:**

1. **Meal Factory (Factory Method)**:
   - Implement a `MealFactory` interface with a method `createMeal()` that returns a meal.
   - Create specific meal factories (e.g., `BurgerFactory`, `SandwichFactory`, `BurritoFactory`) that implement this interface and generate corresponding meal types.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   interface MealFactory {
     createMeal(): Meal;
   }

   class BurgerFactory implements MealFactory {
     createMeal(): Burger {
       return new Burger();
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Meal Customization (Builder Pattern)**:
   - Each meal type (Burger, Sandwich, Burrito) will have its own **Builder** class to allow users to customize it.
   - The builder should allow users to choose from specific options based on the type of meal. For example, for a **burger**, users can select the number of patties, vegetables, and condiments. For a **burrito**, users can select the type of beans, rice, and protein.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   class BurgerBuilder {
     private burger: Burger;

     constructor() {
       this.burger = new Burger();
     }

     setPatties(count: number): this {
       this.burger.patties = count;
       return this;
     }

     addVegetables(veggies: string[]): this {
       this.burger.vegetables = veggies;
       return this;
     }

     build(): Burger {
       return this.burger;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Meal Types and Customization Options:**
   
   **A. Burger**
   - Options: 
     - Number of Patties: (1-3)
     - Cheese: Yes/No
     - Vegetables: Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickles (select multiple)
     - Condiments: Ketchup, Mayo, Mustard
     - Bun Type: Regular, Sesame, Whole Wheat
   
   **B. Sandwich**
   - Options:
     - Bread Type: White, Whole Wheat, Sourdough
     - Protein: Ham, Turkey, Chicken, Veggie
     - Cheese: Yes/No
     - Vegetables: Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Cucumber (select multiple)
     - Sauces: Mustard, Mayo, Pesto

   **C. Burrito**
   - Options:
     - Type of Beans: Black, Pinto
     - Type of Rice: White, Brown
     - Protein: Chicken, Beef, Tofu
     - Toppings: Salsa, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Cheese

4. **Application Flow**:
   - The program will prompt the user to select a meal (Burger, Sandwich, Burrito).
   - Based on the selection, the program will ask a series of questions specific to that meal type, allowing the user to customize their order.
   - Once all the options are selected, the program will output a summary of the meal with all the customizations.

   Example flow:
   ```text
   Welcome to our restaurant! What would you like to order today?
   1. Burger
   2. Sandwich
   3. Burrito

   You chose: Burger
   How many patties? (1-3): 2
   Would you like cheese? (Yes/No): Yes
   Choose your vegetables (Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickles): Lettuce, Tomato
   Choose your condiments (Ketchup, Mayo, Mustard): Mayo
   Choose your bun type (Regular, Sesame, Whole Wheat): Sesame

   Your order:
   - 2-patty burger
   - Cheese: Yes
   - Vegetables: Lettuce, Tomato
   - Condiments: Mayo
   - Bun: Sesame
   ```

5. **Program Output**:
   After completing the customization, the program should display the final order details as shown above. This output will be generated by assembling the input data using the **Builder Pattern** for the meal.

6. **Structure**:
   - **Factory Method** will be used to generate the specific meal type (Burger, Sandwich, Burrito).
   - **Builder Pattern** will be used to add the ingredients and customizations to the meal.

#### üéØ **Bonus Tasks**:
- Add validation to ensure the user enters valid inputs (e.g., choosing between 1-3 for patties).
- Add a "Combo Meal" feature where the user can combine a meal with a drink and fries.

#### üóìÔ∏è **Deadline:** Friday, October 11, 2024
Submit your project in a GitHub repository named `restaurant-order-ts-prelim`. Make sure to include a `README.md` explaining how the project uses the **Factory Method** and **Builder** patterns.


### ** Project uses the **Factory Method** and **Builder** patterns **
The Factory method defines an interface for creating objects that enables subclasses to modify their type.  The Builder pattern is used to create complex objects (Builder classes) that enable to customize meals, making it clear and can be extended. These method patterns are ideal scenarios of ordering systems in restaurant applications.
